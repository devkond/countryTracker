# Country 🌍 Tracker 

In this Python project, the main purpose is to collect data from the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/) and use it to display information about a country based on the user's input. By entering the name of a country, the project will make an API request to retrieve relevant data such as the country's capital, population, region, subregion, and languages spoken.

To implement this project, we will utilize the requests library in Python. This library allows us to send HTTP requests and handle the API responses. With the retrieved data, we can then present it in a user-friendly format to provide insights about the selected country.
